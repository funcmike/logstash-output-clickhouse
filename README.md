# Logstash Plugin

This plugin is a modified version of the Lucidworks logstash json_batch. That plugin is available [here](https://github.com/lucidworks/logstash-output-json_batch). 

It has been modified to support ClickHouse JSON Format, but also supports fault tolerance.

# Usage

Please note that the name of the plugin when used is `clickhouse`, it only supports json in its current form. If further output formats are added in the future, this might change back to json_batch.

    output {
      clickhouse {
        headers => ["Authorization", "Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM="]
        http_hosts => ["http://your.clickhouse1/", "http://your.clickhouse2/", "http://your.clickhouse3/"]
        table => "table_name"
        mutations => {
          "to1" => "from1",
          "to2" => [ "from2", "(.)(.)", '\1\2' ]
        }
      }
    }

## Other custom options
* `save_on_failure` (default: true) - enable / disable request body save on failure
* `save_dir` (default: /tmp) - directory where failed request body will be saved
* `automatic_retries` (default: 1) - number of connect retry attempts to each host in `http_hosts`
* `request_tolerance` (default: 5) - number of http request send retry attempts if response status code is not 200
* `backoff_time` (default: 3) - time to wait in seconds for next retry attempt of connect or request

Default batch size is 50, with a wait of at most 5 seconds per send. These can be tweaked with the parameters `flush_size` and `idle_flush_time` respectively.
